<h1>Cloud VistA</h1>
The US. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is implementing the [U.S. Federal Cloud Computing Strategy](https://cloud.cio.gov/strategy/) for the VA's Veterans Health Information Systems Technology and Architecture (*VISTA*) systems. This strategy incorporates both the U.S. Cloud-First Strategy and U.S. Cloud-Smart Strategy.


<h2>Cloud-First</h2>
In VA's *Cloud-First Strategy* for *VISTA*, VA is migrating *VISTA* from many diverse, decentralized, legacy on-premises data centers to a single, centralized, Federally-certified commercial cloud.  This unifies and modernizes management of the *VISTA* systems and Veteran data, modernizes VA's enterprise IT infrastructure, and eliminates then need to manage and maintain duplicative data centers, allowing legacy infrastructure to be decomissioned.

<h2>Cloud-Smart</h2>
In VA's [*Cloud-Smart Strategy*](https://cloud.cio.gov/strategy/#cloud-smart) for *VISTA*, VA is implementing cloud-specific *VISTA* Adaptive Maintenance (VAM) *within* the VA Enterprise Cloud, which provides a roadmap and software for cloud-native security, scalability, and services for *VISTA* users to the highest standards in the U.S. government, all using straightforward off-the-shelf commercial cloud services and microservices. *VISTA* will be operationalized with the VAM cloud optimizations within VAâ€™s Enterprise Cloud leveraging Amazon Web Services ([AWS](https://aws.amazon.com)).


<h2>Strategic Benefits</h2>
  * Migrate VISTA from disparate VA data centers to single Federally-certified commercial cloud without disturbing veteran care
  * Safely and incrementally centralize VISTA functionality in the Cloud, with *no loss of VA- or veteran-specific care or services*
  * Minimize cost, complexity, and risks of maintaining each of the 130 distinct, decentralized VISTA systems during multi-year VA modernization transition.
  * Centralized, cloud-based, off the shelf monitoring and security of VISTA end-user client activity
  * Current VISTA clients and workflows fully supported and secured
