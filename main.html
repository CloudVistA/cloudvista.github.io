   <h2>Cloud VistA</h2>
<p>The US. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is implementing the [U.S. Federal Cloud Computing Strategy]
  (https://cloud.cio.gov/strategy/) for the VA's Veterans Health Information Systems Technology and Architecture (VISTA) systems. 
  This strategy incorporates both the U.S. Cloud-First Strategy and U.S. Cloud-Smart Strategy.
  </p>

<div class="w3-container w3-black">
<h2>Cloud-First</h2>
<p>In VA's *Cloud-First Strategy* for *VISTA*, VA is migrating *VISTA* from many diverse, decentralized, 
legacy on-premises data centers to a single, centralized, Federally-certified commercial cloud. 
  This unifies and modernizes management of the *VISTA* systems and Veteran data, modernizes 
  VA's enterprise IT infrastructure, and eliminates then need to manage and maintain duplicative data centers, 
  allowing legacy infrastructure to be decomissioned.</p>
</div>
  
 
<div class="w3-container w3-black">
<h2>Cloud-Smart</h2>
<p> In VA's [*Cloud-Smart Strategy*](https://cloud.cio.gov/strategy/#cloud-smart) for *VISTA*, VA is 
  implementing cloud-specific *VISTA* Adaptive Maintenance (VAM) *within* the VA Enterprise Cloud, 
  which provides a roadmap and software for cloud-native security, scalability, and services for *VISTA* users 
  to the highest standards in the U.S. government, all using straightforward off-the-shelf commercial cloud 
  services and microservices. *VISTA* will be operationalized with the VAM cloud optimizations within VAâ€™s Enterprise 
  Cloud leveraging Amazon Web Services ([AWS](https://aws.amazon.com)). </p>

<div class="w3-container w3-black">
<h2>Strategic Benefits</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Migrate VISTA from disparate VA data centers to single Federally-certified commercial cloud without disturbing veteran care</li>
  <li>Safely and incrementally centralize VISTA functionality in the Cloud, with *no loss of VA- or veteran-specific care or services*</li>
  <li>Minimize cost, complexity, and risks of maintaining each of the 130 distinct, decentralized VISTA systems during multi-year VA modernization transition.</li>
  <li>Centralized, cloud-based, off the shelf monitoring and security of VISTA end-user client activity</li>
  <li>Current VISTA clients and workflows fully supported and secured</li>
</ul>
